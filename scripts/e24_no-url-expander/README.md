e24.no, a Norwegian finance news site, has started hiding all their articles behind short-URLs on their front page. This prevents the visitor from reading the URL which often contains more useful information than the clickbaity front page headline.

This script will resolve the short-URL upon hover, restoring the old and more useful behaviour.
